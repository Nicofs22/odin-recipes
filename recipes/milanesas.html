    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Classic dish in Argentinian cuisine, one of the most beloved also. It can be served with french fries,rice,mashed potatoes or a salad.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>These amounts yields 4 servings</p>

    <ul>
       <li>2 large eggs, or more as needed</li>
       <li>40 saltine crackers, smashed</li>
       <li>4 thin slices boneless round steak</li>
       <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
       <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Crack eggs in a medium bowl and beat slightly with a fork or whisk. Set aside. Place smashed crackers on a plate big enough for the steak.</li>
      <li>Season steak with salt and pepper and soak in the beaten egg. Transfer to the smashed crackers and cover both sides with the crackers using a spoon; you can press a little bit with the spoon so that the crackers stick better.</li>
      <li>Heat a frying pan over medium heat and add enough oil to cover the bottom half of the steaks. Cook 2 steaks in the hot oil until crackers have turned light golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Turn and continue to cook until golden and meat is no longer pink, 4 to 5 minutes more. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil. Repeat with remaining steaks.</li>
